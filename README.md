# Youtube player

Build a simple player that can accept a search query and fetch a list of matching videos from
youtube. A user should be able to:

- Search for videos
- Click a video to play now
- Enqueue a video for later
- See a history of most recent video plays

To keep the project focused, do not rely on any build tools. You do not need to ensure files
are ready for production, e.g. no minification or file name digests. Every application should share
the same stylesheet.
